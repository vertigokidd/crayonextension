# GetYourCrayon

A Chrome extension that allows a user to navigate to any webpage and start drawing on it. The extension also has the ability to save a drawing to a database using HTTP requests.

This extension is designed to be used in tandem with the GetYourCrayon Rails app. Installation instructions can be found on that [repo](https://github.com/ibarroladt/GetYourCrayon).

## Installation

Clone the repo to your local machine. In the Chrome browser, open 'Extensions' and switch to developer mode. Load the directory as an unpacked extension.

## Testing

Jasmine is used for unit testing the drawController script. The jasminespec folder contains a SpecRunner HTML file that can be loaded in the browser to run tests.
